I had no group or partner for this project.

For testing please follow instructions given by program and enter what is requested. Lists (and sets) should be entered by surrounding with parens but don't need the leading apostrophe ('). Please only enter integer values when numbers are requested.
When entering values avoid using quotation marks (both in lists and when asked to enter a vlue to find in a list)
#t means true (or found)
#f means false (or not found)

At the end of the program the user can enter more functions to test if they wish on the input line.
